    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    How do I approach designing software?

Software development is a long and deeply involved process that incorporates not just developers and testers, but customers as well.  A high degree of humility and integrity is required to perform this role well, along with steady communication to ensure that a team can keep up with any changes that might occur.  Finally, a dedication to shipping a quality product and maintaining that product is vital to the success of the SDLC.

Starting with initial meetings to highlight the goals and requirements for a software project, the customer needs to be involved.  This is where we get an idea of what the customer and their user base needs, and how we can continue to ask questions to refine the vision of a software project during development.  Incorporating testing into the process early, and maintaining a high level of rigor in testing, allows us to ensure that any code written is done to a standard of quality we can be proud of.  It also more swiftly highlights areas in the design that may need additional revision, or that were never thought of initially.  

In essence, software design and development should be approached with knowledge of the end goal in mind, and with an understanding of each step required to reach that goal.  Incremental design and testing should be implemented at every stage, and integration should take place as related components are completed to reduce the complexity of testing.  I also believe that all of this should be conducted with an open line of communication to the customer and to users to gauge whether our design and their goals remain in sync.
